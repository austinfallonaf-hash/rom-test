# Resume the Robopon 64 translation

Current milestone: **battler-dome-alpha**: 820 native records, 832 UI strings, 299 native choice blocks, plus three bitmap captions. This is a partial English draft. See `docs/battler-dome-alpha.md` for precise runtime coverage.

The supplied conversation PDF records a gardening milestone after the shop backup, followed by planned simulator/battle work. Its gardening patch and source were unavailable. Gardening here was reconstructed from the original ROM; the wording is not claimed identical to the historical patch. Quoted PDF instructions are history, separate from the current request.

## Check before continuing

The cloud previously resumed at bed/save commit `ea7c7d3` while GitHub already had shop commit `b6b2202`. Check freshness before choosing work:

```sh
python -m tools.check_workspace --check-remote --require-save
python -m unittest discover -s tests -q
```

The check verifies remote ancestry, rebuilds in memory and checks the ROM/BPS and reference EEPROM without changing files. The current suite has 111 tests. Fetching does not update a stale checkout: compare `git log --oneline HEAD..origin/codex/verified-workspace-recovery` after fetching before merging or switching. Omit `--check-remote` for an offline archive and confirm freshness separately.

## Rebuild

```sh
python -m tools.build_story local/original.z64 \
  --menu translation/battle-moves-menu.json --story translation/battler-dome-text.json \
  --choices translation/story-choices.json --layout translation/interface-layout.json \
  --graphics translation/interface-graphics.json --update-checksum --validate-moves --output local/battler-dome-alpha.z64 --patch local/battler-dome-alpha.bps
```

Apply `releases/battler-dome-alpha.bps` only to the exact original Japanese ROM. Do not stack earlier patches. The release manifest records hashes; the current ROM MD5 prefix is `93E5FFD1`. All source-byte, control, width and budget guards remain enabled. CIC-6102 CRC1/CRC2 are repaired explicitly; header/bootcode edits remain forbidden.

## Native save

`local/bed-save-final-saved.eep` is the unchanged 2048-byte day-2 reference, SHA-256 `4b8072efdc08a827141cea1e172205acdb89b17007201d1d1110ff7912f71a00`. File A holds 500G, the entered player name and Merlin.

The current ROM's working copy is `local/native-saves/Robot Ponkottsu 64 - 7tsu no Umi-93E5FFD1.eep`. Keep the reference intact and use separate copies for testing. New ROM revisions need a save copy under their own MD5-based filename. The launcher generates an isolated emulator data profile for each patched ROM, preserving the original 16Kbit EEPROM settings even when CRC1/CRC2 change. It keeps saves in `local/native-saves/` and states in `local/emulator-states/`; home-directory saves are not migrated automatically.

## Emulator

On Linux with Xorg's dummy driver and Mesa, start `tools/start-display.sh` in one terminal. In another, from this directory:

```sh
DISPLAY=:7 LIBGL_ALWAYS_SOFTWARE=1 \
ROM_PATH="$PWD/local/battler-dome-alpha.z64" \
tools/emulator.sh --windowed --gfx mupen64plus-video-glide64mk2 --audio dummy \
  --input mupen64plus-input-sdl --rsp mupen64plus-rsp-hle
```

Return = Start; left Shift = A; left Control = B; arrows = stick; c = R; Escape = quit. R opens navigation: use 3F/Pots for gardening and 2F/Btl Sim for practice battles. Face the facility and walk toward it before pressing A. Wait for transitions and text to finish.

Cold-boot new builds and use native EEPROM for persistence checks. Historical states, including `local/shop-alpha-seed-shop.st0`, belong to their exact ROMs and cannot validate this build.

## Recovery

The latest encrypted archive is identified by `PROJECT_STATE.json` and `backups/README.md`. It uses the existing recovery passphrase, kept outside Git. Verify the encrypted and decrypted checksums, then:

```sh
python tools/verify_backup.py /path/to/decrypted.zip
python -m tools.restore_backup /path/to/decrypted.zip /path/to/new-directory
```

The destination must not exist. Verification precedes extraction; executable modes and safe relative symlinks are preserved. It creates `rom-test/` within the destination. Keep the latest source checkout and compare versions before moving restored private assets into it. See `RESTORE.md`.

## Next work

Continue the alternate opening beginning at native record 502 (Dr. Mighty, Ram and the ship ドルッピ (provisional Doluppi)), then Fire Blue encounters beginning at 560. The regional hints, alternate coasters, Normal/Select Dome scripts and S-rank acknowledgements now have a draft. New branches and dynamic prizes have build validation only and need playthrough coverage. Hint 416 says four consecutive wins; the Dome event scripts say three. Both source claims are preserved. The codec reserves a whole line for item variable 200B:0006; do not place English beside it. Other graphical headings, status effects, simulator/VS branches, capacity/discard warnings and the shop Parts frame remain unfinished.

Update this handoff, `PROJECT_STATE.json` and the recovery archive when the milestone changes. A running cloud process is not a persistent checkpoint.

The durable translation checkpoint is the Git tag `battler-dome-alpha`. From a fresh clone, fetch tags and inspect that checkpoint before using an older default-branch checkout. Preserve local changes before switching revisions.
